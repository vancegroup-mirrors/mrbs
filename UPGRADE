Upgrade Information for previous releases of MRBS:
--------------------------------------------------

If you are upgrading from MRBS 1.2-pre3 or later, then MRBS will
automatically execute any necessary database upgrades when it is first
run.   It will prompt you for a database (not MRBS) username and password
with rights to create and alter tables.

It would be a sensible precaution to take a backup of your database before
the upgrade.

MRBS database upgrades are in general intended to be backwards compatible,
so that you should still be able to run the old version of MRBS against the
new database schema.   This will allow you to install the new version of MRBS
in a separate directory while you configure and test it.   When you are happy
with the new release you can switch the directory to be your production
directory.

There are however some exceptions to this backward compatiblity, namely at
the following transitions:

MRBS 1.4.4.1 -> 1.4.5

In these cases you will not be able to run the old version of MRBS against
the upgraded database.   You may therefore choose to make a copy of the
database for test purposes and check that the upgrade process works before
performing the upgrade on your production database.


Upgrading from prior MRBS 1.4.5
===============================
MRBS 1.4.5 introduces the concept of tentative bookings, or bookings that
require confirmation.   To avoid confusion, what were previously known as
"provisional bookings" have now been renamed "bookings requiring approval"
and the config variable $provisional_enabled has been renamed
$approval_enabled.   You should update your config file accordingly.

Please also see the note about database compatibility above.


Upgrading from prior MRBS 1.2-pre3
==================================

mrbs 1.2-pre3 introduced area and room administrator email fields.

Please apply the upgrade3.my.sql to add these fields. This file should work 
both with mysql and pgsql.


Upgrading from prior MRBS 1.2-pre2
==================================

Upgrading mysql database from previous charsets to Unicode :

	  You can use convert_db_to_utf8.php script to convert text in the 
	  database to UTF8, to use MRBS with $unicode_encoding set to 1. The 
	  administrator should copy it into the web directory, run it (choosing  
	  the encoding to convert from) ONCE, and then move it back out of the 
	  web directory. We recommend you backup your database before running 
	  this script if you are at all worried.
	  Running it more than once will make a right mess of any non-ASCII 
	  text in the database. 
	  
	  
Upgrading from prior to MRBS 1.0 final
======================================

Please apply the upgrade2.my.sql (if using MySQL) or the
the upgrade2.pg.sql (if using PostgreSQL) script, which
adds a new column to the 'mrbs_repeat' table to support
"n-weekly" repeats.


Upgrading from prior to MRBS 1.0-pre1
======================================

A change in version 1.0-pre1 might affect the appearance of entries in your
existing database. Prior versions of MRBS did an extra and unnecessary
level of backslash-escaping on room, area, and entry names and
descriptions. This applied to certain characters such as single quote
mark(') and backslash(\). As of version 1.0-pre1, these characters are
handled correctly. If you see extra backslashes when MRBS displays names or
descriptions, it is because these are in actually your database.  You can
edit the entries in MRBS or directly with your database SQL tool, or just
ignore them.


Upgrading from prior to MRBS 0.7
================================
There was a change to the database schema at version 0.7. See the
information in INSTALL on using the upgrade.my.sql script.
