Currently supported MRBS languages are:

To port MRBS to another language is relativly easy.

Look it admin.php - it says near the bottom "Your browser is set to use
"xx" language".

Copy "lang.en" to "lang.xx" (replace xx with the code you found in
admin.php) and then edit the file to change the English strings to your
language.

You will then find that MRBS starts to use your language file
automatically.

If you do create a language file then please send it to me so I can include
it in future releases.
