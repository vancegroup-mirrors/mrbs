    <h4>How do I login?</h4>
    <p>
      The system can be configured to use one of several methods of authentication,
      including LDAP, Netware, and SMB. See your system administrator if you
      are having trouble logging in. Some functions are restricted to certain
      users, and other users will get the message <q>You do not have access rights to
      modify this item</q>. See your system administrator if this is not working
      correctly for you.
      If the system is configured to use LDAP authentication, this means that you
      login with the same username and password as you use for getting email
      e.g. <q>Mark Belanger</q> and <q>MyPassword</q>.

  <div id="meeting_delete">
    <h4>Why can't I delete/alter a meeting?</h4>
    <p>
      In order to delete or alter a meeting, you must be logged in as the
      same person that made the meeting.  Contact one of the meeting room
      administrators or the person who initially made the meeting to
      have it deleted or changed.

    <h4>How do I make a recurring meeting?</h4>
    <p>
      Clicking on the desired time brings you into the booking screen.
      Select the appropriate <dfn>Repeat Type</dfn>. The room will be scheduled
      at the same time, until the <dfn>Repeat End Date</dfn>, on the days
      determined by the Repeat Type.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A <dfn>Daily</dfn> repeat schedules every day.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <dfn>Weekly</dfn> repeat schedules those days of the week that you
        check under <dfn>Repeat Day</dfn>. For example, use Weekly repeat
        to schedule the room every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday; check
        those days under Repeat Day. If you check no days under Repeat Day,
        the schedule will repeat on the same day of each week as the first
        scheduled day.
      </li>
      <li>
        An <dfn>N_Weekly</dfn> repeat is the same as a Weekly repeat, except
        that the bookings are only made for every Nth week where N is 
        entered under <dfn>Number of Weeks</dfn>.   For example, to make
        a booking for every other week, use 2 for the number of weeks.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <dfn>Monthly</dfn> repeat schedules the same day of each month,
        for example the 15th of the month.  If you select the 29th, 30th
        or 31st of the month, then for a month where that day does not
        exist the last day of that month will be used instead.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <dfn>Yearly</dfn> repeat schedules the same month and day of the month,
        for example every March 15th.   If you select the 29th February, then
        for those years where that date does not exist the 28th February will
        be used instead.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, a <dfn>Monthly, corresponding day</dfn> repeat schedules one day
        each month, the same weekday and ordinal position within the month.
        Use this repeat type to schedule the first Monday, second Tuesday,
        or fourth Friday of each month, for example.  If you have selected the 29th, 30th
        or 31st of the month, i.e. the fifth weekday of a month, then for those 
        months where there is no corresponding fifth day, the fourth day will 
        be used instead.  (This is a useful way of booking the last weekday in
        every month).

    <h4>How do I delete one instance of a recurring meeting?</h4>

  <div id="multiple_sites">
    <h4>How do I schedule rooms at different sites?</h4>
    <p>
      You don't.  Presently the system cannot book two different rooms simultaneously.
      You must schedule each one separately.  Make sure that the time you want
      is available at both sites before making a booking.

  <div id="too_many">
    <h4>My meeting failed to be created because of <q>too many entries</q>!</h4>
    <p>
      No meeting can create more than 365 entries.  There needs to be some limit on the number of meetings created.  
      This number can be increased if necessary.
    </p>
    <a href="#top">Top</a>
  </div>
  
  <div id="multiple_users">
    <h4>What happens if multiple people schedule the same meeting?</h4>
    <p>
      The short answer is: The first person to click on
      the <dfn>Submit</dfn> button wins.
      Behind the scenes, the system is using a proper multi-user, multi-threaded
      relational database than can handle many thousands of simultaneous users.

  <div id="internal_external">
    <h4>What is the difference between <q>Internal</q> and <q>External</q>?</h4>
    <p>
      By default, MRBS defines two meeting types. <dfn>Internal</dfn> means that the
      meeting will only be attended by employees.  An <dfn>External</dfn> meeting
      might also be attended by customers, vendors, investors, etc. Your site
      can define up to a total of 10 meeting types, according to your needs.
      Meetings are highlighted in the main calendar view with a color corresponding
      to their type, and a color key of all defined types is shown at the bottom
      of the main calendar view.

    <h4>How does the system work and who wrote it?</h4>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=5113">Meeting Room Booking System</a>
      is open source software that is distributed under the Gnu Public License(GPL).
      This means that software is free to use, distribute, and modify. 
    </p> 
    <p>
      The system is written mostly in <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a>, 
      which is an open source programming language that can be embedded in web 
      pages similar in concept to Microsoft active server pages.  PHP is especially 
      good at accessing databases.
    </p>
    <p>  
      The database used for the system is either
      <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a>
      or <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>.
      MySQL is a very fast, multi-threaded, multi-user and robust 
      SQL (Structured Query Language) database server that is also GPL.
      PostgreSQL is a full-featured multi-user open source Object Relational SQL
      database server.
    </p>
    <p> 
      The system will run on multiple platforms, including the PC architecture
      using the <a href="http://www.linux.com">Linux</a> operating system.
      Linux, is a free, open source, unix-like operating system.
    </p>
    <p>
      The web server being used is yet another piece of free, open source
      software.  The <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache</a> web server is
      the world's most popular web server.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bottom line is: <strong>every piece of this system, from the operating system to the application,
      is completely free - source code and all</strong>.
