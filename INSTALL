		WebCalendar Installation Instructions


NOTE: If updagrading a previous from a previous version, see the file
UPGRADING first.


REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You must have both MySQL and PHP (built with MySQL support) installed
(and working) for this application.  See the PHP (www.php.net) and
MySQL (www.mysql.com) pages for more info on setting up PHP/MySQL.

No optional PHP packages (other than MySQL) are required for this
application.

You can run PHP either as a CGI or an Apache module.  You'll get better
performance with PHP setup as a module.  Not only will you not have to
deal with the CGI performance hit, but you'll be able to use PHP's
database connection pooling.


FILE UNPACKING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unpack the calendar software in its own directory somewhere where
your web server will find it.  (See your web server docs for info.)


DATABASE SETUP
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can place the calendar db tables in an existing database or
create a new database with the following:
	mysqladmin create intranet
(This will create a database named "intranet".)

Create the calendar tables using the supplied tables.sql file:
	mysql intranet < tables.sql
where "intranet" is the name of your database (mentioned above).
This will create all the needed tables and setup one user account
with the login "admin" and password "admin", which you are encouraged
to use to create your own account.


APPLICATION SETUP
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can place the calendar db tables in an existing database or
Next, you will need to customize the file "config.inc"...

To configure your MySQL access.  Set the values for:
  - $mysql_host		The hostname that MySQL is running on
			(Use localhost if it's the same machine as
			the web server)
  - $mysql_login	The MySQL login
  - $mysql_password	The MySQL password for the above login
  - $mysql_database	The name of the MySQL database that the calendar
			tables reside in.  ("intranet" in the example
			above.)

You can configure the calendar to run in single-user mode or multi-user mode.
If this is your first time using the calendar, it's easier to try single-user.
You can always switch to multi-user later.  Leave the $single_user_login
variable commented out (the default) for multi-user, or remove the
"//" comment tags to set the system to single-user mode.  (And be sure
to set the value of $single_user_login to the login that you would choose
if you decide to switch to multi-user mode some day.)

Note: If you do decide to switch from single-user mode to multi-user mode,
make sure you add in a user to the system for the login you set the
$single_user_login variable to.


OPTIONAL!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You might want to configure your web server so that users can not obtain
the ".inc" files.  For example, if a user typed in the URL for the
"config.inc" file, they would be able to see your MySQL login and password,
which is not a good thing.  See your web server documentation on how to
do this.


RUN WITH IT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can place the calendar db tables in an existing database or
Hey, you're done...  Give it a try by logging in using the default
"admin" account (if you're setup for multi-user) or just go to index.php3
if you're setup for single-user mode.
