<a name="authenticate"></a><h4>How do I login?</h4>
<p>The system can be configured to use one of several methods of authentication,
including LDAP, Netware, and SMB. See your system administrator if you
are having trouble logging in. Some functions are restricted to certain
users, and other users will get the message <i>You do not have access rights to
modify this item</i>. See your system administrator if this is not working
correctly for you.
If the system is configured to use LDAP authentication, this means that you
login with the same username and password as you use for getting email
i.e. "Mark Belanger" "MyPassword".

<a name="meeting_delete"></a><h4>Why can't I delete/alter a meeting?</h4>
<p>In order to delete or alter a meeting, you must be logged in as the
same person that made the meeting.  Contact one of the meeting room
administrators or the person who initially made the meeting to
have it deleted or changed.

<a name="repeating"></a><h4>How do I make a recurring meeting?</h4>
<p>Clicking on the desired time brings you into the booking screen.
Select the appropriate <b>Repeat Type</b>. The room will be scheduled
at the same time, until the <b>Repeat End Date</b>, on the days
determined by the <b>Repeat Type</b>.</p>
<p>A <i>Daily</i> repeat schedules every day.
A <i>Weekly</i> repeat schedules those days of the week that you
check under <b>Repeat Day</b>. For example, use Weekly repeat
to schedule the room every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday; check
those days under Repeat Day. If you check no days under Repeat Day,
the schedule will repeat on the same day of each week as the first
scheduled day.
A <i>Monthly</i> repeat schedules the same day of each month,
for example the 15th of the month.
A <i>Yearly</i> repeat schedules the same month and day of the month,
for example every March 15th.
Finally, a <i>Monthly, corresponding day</i> repeat schedules one day
each month, the same weekday and ordinal position within the month.
Use this repeat type to schedule the first Monday, second Tuesday,
or fourth Friday of each month, for example.
Do not use this repeat type after the 28th day of the month.</p>

<a name="repeating_delete"></a><h4>How do I delete one instance recurring meeting?</h4>
<p>Select the day/room/time that you want to delete and select <b>Delete Entry</b>.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Top</a></p><hr>

<a name="multiple_sites"></a><h4>How do I schedule rooms at different sites?</h4>
<p>You don't.  Presently the system cannot book 2 different rooms simultaneously.
You must schedule each one separately.  Make sure that the time you want
is available at both sites before making a booking.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Top</a></p><hr>

<a name="too_many"></a><h4>My meeting failed to be created because of "<i>too many entries</i>"!</h4>
<p>Any meeting cannot create more than 365 entries.  There needs to be some limit on the number of meetings created.  This number can be increased if necessary.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Top</a></p><hr>

<a name="multiple_users"></a><h4>What happens if multiple people schedule the same meeting?</h4>
<p>The short answer is: The first person to click on
the <b>Submit</b> button wins.<br>
Behind the scenes, the system is using a proper multi-user, multi-threaded
relational database than can handle many thousands of simultaneous users.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Top</a></p><hr>

<a name="internal_external"></a><h4>What is the difference between "Internal" and "External"</h4>
<p>By default, MRBS defines two meeting types. <b>"Internal"</b> means that the
meeting will only be attended by employees.  An <b>"External"</b> meeting
might also be attended by customers, vendors, investors, etc. Your site
can define up to a total of 10 meeting types, according to your needs.
Meetings are highlighted in the main calendar view with a color corresponding
to their type, and a color key of all defined types is shown at the bottom
of the main calendar view.</p>

<a name="how_much"></a><h4>How much did the system cost?</h4>
<p>Nothing.  See the next section for more information.</p>

<a name="about"></a><h4>How does the system work and who wrote it?</h4>
<p>
The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=5113">Meeting Room Booking System</a>
is open source software that is distributed under the Gnu Public License(GPL).
This means that software is free to use, distribute, and modify.  
<p>
The system is written mostly in <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a>, 
which is an open source programming language that can be embedded in web 
pages similar in concept to Microsoft active server pages.  PHP is especially 
good at accessing databases.
<p>  
The database used for the system is either
<a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a>
or <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>.
MySQL is a very fast, multi-threaded, multi-user and robust 
SQL (Structured Query Language) database server that is also GPL.
PostgreSQL is a full-featured multi-user open source Object Relational SQL
database server.
<p> 
The system will run on multiple platforms, including the PC architecture
using the <a href="http://www.linux.com">Linux</a> operating system.
Linux, is a free, open source, unix-like operating system.
<p>
The web server being used is yet another piece of free, open source
software.  The <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache</a> web server is
the world's most popular web server.
<p>
The bottom line is: <b>Every piece of this system, from the operating system to the application,
is completely free - source code and all</b>.
