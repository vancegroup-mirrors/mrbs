        MRBS Installation Instructions



REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
MRBS now works with both MySQL and PostgreSQL database systems. You must
have PHP with support for your chosen database system installed and working
for this application. See the PHP (www.php.net), MySQL (www.mysql.com), and
PostgreSQL (www.postgresql.org) sites for more info on setting these up.
You need to know how to install, secure, run, maintain, and back up your
chosen database system.

No optional PHP packages (other than the database system) are required for
this application. This version of MRBS was tested with PHP 4.0.4, and there
are reports of it working with PHP 3.0.12 and higher. (If you use PHP3,
you must configure your web server to process *.php files (as well as the
default *.php3 files) using PHP.)

You can run PHP either as a CGI or an Apache module.  You'll get better
performance with PHP setup as a module.  Not only will you not have to
deal with the CGI performance hit, but you'll be able to use PHP's
database connection pooling. However, be careful that you don't exceed
the maximum number of connections allowed to your database; with connection
pooling PHP/Apache can potentially create a connection from each Apache
child server to the database.

If you are using PHP as an Apache module, you probably want to ensure that
the Apache MaxRequestsPerChild is not set to 0, in case of undetected memory
leaks in PHP or MRBS.

If you use MySQL, versions 3.22.32 and 3.23.23 have been tested and reported
to work.

If you use PostgreSQL, you need at least version 7.0, and version 7.0.3 has
been tested and reported to work.

FILE UNPACKING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To install MRBS, just unpack the distribution into a temporary directory,
then copy the files in the "web" subdirectory into a new directory somewhere
your web server can find them.

For example:

Unpack the software into a new temporary directory, something like this:
	$ tar -xvzf ~/download/mrbs-1.0.tgz       (or whatever version)
	$ cd mrbs-1.0                             (or whatever version)

If you are upgrading from a previous version of MRBS, you should save your
"config.inc" file so you can compare and update the new file with your
site-specific changes. Then rename your existing MRBS web server directory.
For example:
	$ cp /var/lib/apache/htdocs/mrbs/config.inc config.site.inc
	$ mv /var/lib/apache/htdocs/mrbs /var/lib/apache/htdocs/mrbs.old

Now install MRBS by copying the contents of the "web" subdirectory of the
distribution somewhere your web server can find it.  For example:
    $ cp -r web /var/lib/apache/htdocs/mrbs

DATABASE SETUP
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are upgrading from MRBS version 0.7 or later, and continuing to
use MySQL, your database is already set up, so you can skip to the
Application Setup section.

For a new install:

You can place the MRBS database tables in an existing database or
create a new database with the following:
[MySQL]         $ mysqladmin create mrbs
[PostgreSQL]    $ createdb mrbs
(This will create a database named "mrbs", but you can use any name.)

Create the MRBS tables using the supplied tables.*.sql file:
[MySQL]         $ mysql mrbs < tables.my.sql
[PostgreSQL]    $ psql -a -f tables.pg.sql mrbs
where "mrbs" is the name of your database (mentioned above).
This will create all the needed tables.
You may need to set rights on the tables; for PostgreSQL see "grant.pg.sql".
If you need to delete the tables, for PostgreSQL see "destroy.pg.sql".

The tables are now empty and ready for use. If you want to add a few sample
areas and rooms without going through the Admin function, use this script:
[MySQL]         $ mysql mrbs < sample-data.sql
[PostgreSQL]    $ psql -a -f sample-data.sql mrbs
Substitute the database name you used for "mrbs".
This script is only for use in a newly initialized database! (It will not
work properly in a database where the ID counters are greater than 0.)
Also see the description of testdata.php in the README file.

For an upgrade:
The database format changed slightly between 0.6 and 0.7. To change the
format of your data do:
[MySQL]         $ mysql mrbs < upgrade.my.sql
(This does not apply to PostgreSQL, which was not supported then.)
Also see the file UPGRADE in the distribution.

Maintenance:
Be sure to back up your database regularly.
For PostgreSQL, be sure to run the "vacuum" command regularly.
You can clean out old entries from your database using the supplied SQL
scripts purge.my.sql (for MySQL) and purge.pg.sql (for PostgreSQL). Read
the comments at the top of the scripts before using them.

APPLICATION SETUP
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next, you will need to customize the file "config.inc"...

If you are upgrading from a previous version of MRBS, use your saved
copy of "config.inc" as a reference. Do not just use your old config.inc
file, however, because there changes and new settings.

Refer to the comments in the supplied config.inc file for more details.
The following sections can be configured:


1. Database Settings:

First, select your database system. Define either:
    $dbsys = "mysql";
or,
    $dbsys = "pgsql";

Then define your database connection parameters. Set the values for:

    $db_host =      The hostname that the database server is running on.
    $db_database =  The name of the database containing the MRBS tables.
    $db_login =     The database login username
    $db_password =  The database login password for the above login username

If the database server and web server are the same machine, use 
$db_host="localhost". Or, with PostgreSQL only, you can use $db_host="" to
use Unix Domain Sockets to connect to the database server on the same machine.

By default, MRBS will use PHP persistent (pooled) database connections,
for better performance. Depending on your web server and database server
configuration, it is possible that this will cause MRBS to reach the maximum
number of connections allowed to your database, since each Apache child
process may keep a connection open. Then, users will randomly get errors
when trying connecting to MRBS.  If you would rather use non-persistent
database connections, uncomment the line in "config.inc" which sets the
$db_nopersist variable.


2. Site Identification:

Specify your company or site name, and contact information. The company name
is displayed at the top of each page, and the contact information is
displayed in the help file.
	$mrbs_admin = "Your Administrator";
	$mrbs_admin_email = "admin_email@your.org";
	$mrbs_company = "Your Company";


3. Calendar Settings:

Specify the resolution in minutes. MRBS will display blocks of this size,
and will round up all entries to an even multiple of this many minutes.
Specify a number which divides evenly into hours, for example one of:
	$resolution =  900;   # 15 minutes
	$resolution = 1800;   # Half hour
	$resolution = 3600;   # Whole hours

Specify the start and end of the day in 24 hour notation, using whole hours.
	$morningstarts = 7;   # First block is 7 AM.
	$eveningends = 19;    # Last block starts at 7 PM.
There is also $eveningends_minutes to give you more control over the last
block displayed for each day. For example, to display full 24 hour days
with 30 minute intervals:
	$resolution = 1800;
	$morningstarts = 0;
	$eveningends = 23;
	$eveningends_minutes = 30;

To control international preferences for the calendar displays, use
$weekstarts to change the first day of the week from the default of
Sunday; use $dateformat to show dates as "Month Day" or "Day Month"
in the page footers.

There's also a section about Language. MRBS supports multiple languages,
which can be used at the same time, based on what the client is using. One
of the environment variables supplied to PHP is $HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE,
which we use to choose a language file. You can specify the default in
config.inc. See the file called LANGUAGE for more info.


4. Miscellaneous Settings:

These settings control the maximum number of repeat entries which can
be created at once (a safety feature), the default report time period,
and the number of search results to return per page.


5. Authentication:

Read the file AUTHENTICATION for information about this section.  By
default, config.inc uses "ip" authentication, allowing anyone who
can connect to book rooms, and only allowing localhost to administer
the system.


6. Language:

MRBS also uses your OS locale support for certain date/time strings.
There is some code that tries to figure out what locale should be used
based on your browser. Use "locale -a" on your system to find out what
locale support is installed.


7. Entry Types:

By default, MRBS defines two "meeting types" - internal and external. There
are a total of 10 types ready to be used, if you assign names to them in
your config.inc file. Each type has a color, defined in the style sheet.


HELP/FAQ File:

Customize site_faq.html if desired.  It contains help that can be tailored
to your environment.


SECURITY NOTES!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Configure your web server so that users can not obtain the ".inc" files. 
For example, if a user typed in the URL for the "config.inc" file, they
would be able to see your database login and password, which is not a good
thing.  See your web server documentation on how to do this.

There is an Apache .htaccess file included, but Apache might ignore it because 
of the "AllowOverride None" in your httpd.conf. Either change "AllowOverride
None" to "AllowOverride Limit", create a new <Directory> entry with the
contents of the .htaccess file in it, or add the contents of the .htaccess
to httpd.conf where it says "<Files ~ "^\.ht">". And then read the Apache
docs five or six times, until you know what you just did.

You should protect "config.inc" to only allow the web server to read it.
For example:   # chown httpd config.inc; chmod 400 config.inc

The script "testdata.php" is for testing only.  Do not leave it in a
directory accessible to your web server. Anyone running this will add a
large number of test entries to your database, regardless of
authentication, and book all your rooms to people you've never heard of.
