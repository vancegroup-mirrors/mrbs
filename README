Meeting Room Booking System
http://mrbs.sourceforge.net/
-------------------------------

The Meeting Room Booking System (MRBS) is a PHP-based application for
booking meeting rooms (surprisingly!). I got annoyed with the piles of books
which were being used to book meetings. They were slow, hard to edit and only
at the reception desk. I thought that a nice web-based system would be much
nicer.

Some parts of this are based on WebCalender 0.9.4 by Craig Knudsen 
(http://www.radix.net/~cknudsen/webcalendar/) but there is now very little
which is similar. There are fundamental design goal differences between
WebCalendar and MRBS - WC is for individuals, MRBS is for meeting rooms.

------
To Use
------
See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

Once it's installed try going to http://yourhost/mrbs/ - if you loaded the
sample data, this should give you a view of the first area meeting rooms
for today. The (+) symbol means you can add new meetings by clicking
there. Try it - it should all be pretty obvious. If you haven't loaded the
sample data, start by clicking on Admin to add your Areas and Rooms.

By default, anyone who can connect can add new meetings, and only connections
from localhost are administrators. Only administrators can add rooms and
areas, and modify any other users' meetings.  See AUTHENTICATION for a more
complete description of the authentication system and how to configure it.

If you copy testdata.php into your web site, you can view
http://yourhost/mrbs/testdata.php - it will generate a whole load of random
appointments to fill up the calendar and let you play around. (Don't leave
testdata.php in your web site, though.)

Originally this was tested with PHP 3.0.16, Apache 1.3.12, MySQL 3.22.32 and
Linux 2.2.14. The latest version was tested with PHP 4.0.4, Apache 1.3.12,
and either MySQL 3.22.32 or PostgreSQL 7.0.3. It should work on just about
anything that's got PHP with MySQL or PostgreSQL support - let me know.

It should be pretty easy to adjust it to your corporate colours - the file
mrbs.css is used on every page, as is style.inc. Just fiddle with these until
you get the result you like. If it's really funky then please send it to me,
and I'll start some sort of 'skin' collection!

------
Usage:
------
I'm using it at work, with about 150 clients, and other reports of successful
use have been seen on the mailing list.  If you do start using it can you
drop me a note to let me know how you've got on.
