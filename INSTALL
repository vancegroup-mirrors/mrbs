		MRBS Installation Instructions



REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You must have both MySQL and PHP (built with MySQL support) installed
(and working) for this application.  See the PHP (www.php.net) and
MySQL (www.mysql.com) pages for more info on setting up PHP/MySQL.

No optional PHP packages (other than MySQL) are required for this
application.

You can run PHP either as a CGI or an Apache module.  You'll get better
performance with PHP setup as a module.  Not only will you not have to
deal with the CGI performance hit, but you'll be able to use PHP's
database connection pooling.


FILE UNPACKING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unpack the calendar software in its own directory somewhere where
your web server will find it.  (See your web server docs for info.)


DATABASE SETUP
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can place the calendar db tables in an existing database or
create a new database with the following:
	mysqladmin create mrbs
(This will create a database named "mrbs".)

Create the calendar tables using the supplied tables.sql file:
	mysql mrbs < tables.sql
where "mrbs" is the name of your database (mentioned above).
This will create all the needed tables.


APPLICATION SETUP
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can place the calendar db tables in an existing database or
Next, you will need to customize the file "config.inc"...

To configure your MySQL access.  Set the values for:
  - $mysql_host		The hostname that MySQL is running on
			(Use localhost if it's the same machine as
			the web server)
  - $mysql_login	The MySQL login
  - $mysql_password	The MySQL password for the above login
  - $mysql_database	The name of the MySQL database that the calendar
			tables reside in.  ("mrbs" in the example
			above.)


OPTIONAL!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You might want to configure your web server so that users can not obtain
the ".inc" files.  For example, if a user typed in the URL for the
"config.inc" file, they would be able to see your MySQL login and password,
which is not a good thing.  See your web server documentation on how to
do this.
